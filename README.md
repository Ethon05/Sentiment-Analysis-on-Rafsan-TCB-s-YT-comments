# Sentiment Analysis on Rafsan The Choto Bhai's Youtube channel's comments
Sentiment analysis is an emerging field of research that
involves the use of natural language processing and
machine learning techniques to identify and analyze the
attitudes, emotions, and opinions of people toward various
topics. With the growing popularity of social media
platforms, sentiment analysis has become a crucial area of
research to understand people's sentiments toward various
social issues, products, and services. Youtube, being one of
the most popular social media platforms, provides a vast
amount of user-generated content, including comments on
Youtube videos.In recent years, sentiment analysis has
gained popularity in various fields, including social media
analysis. The aim of this project is to perform sentiment
analysis on the comments section of Bangladeshi Youtuber
Rafsan The Choto Bhai's YouTube videos. Rafsan The
Choto Bhai is a well-known and popular Bangladeshi
YouTuber who creates content on various topics such as
lifestyle, entertainment, education, and current affairs.
Analyzing the sentiment of the comments section of his
videos will provide insights into the opinions and emotions
of his viewers regarding the topics he covers. The project
aims to use machine learning techniques to classify the
comments into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
Analyzing Youtube comments can provide valuable insights

II. RELATED WORK
Several studies have been conducted on sentiment analysis
in various fields such as marketing, politics, and social
media. However, very little research has been done on
sentiment analysis of Bangladeshi Youtubers' comment
sections. One study that is relevant to this project is the
sentiment analysis of the comment section of PewDiePie's
YouTube videos. The study used machine learning
techniques to classify the comments into positive, negative,
and neutral sentiments. The results showed that the majority
of the comments were positive, and the sentiment of the
comments was influenced by the content of the videos.
